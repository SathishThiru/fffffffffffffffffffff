OOPs - Class, method, object, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and Encapsualtion


Abstraction - Hiding of implementation information
Abtraction - we can have full abstraction or partial abstraction
Full abstraction - it is achieved using Interface
Partial abstraction is achieved suing Abstract classes

Tto create a abstract class you will be using a keyword called 'abstract'

In an abstracct class, we can have both abbbbbstract method aand  non-abstract mmethods




Abstract class and Interface will have abstract methods with no logic inside. These methods should be implemented in child classes.
