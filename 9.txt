return type of a method:
return statement should be last statement of a method




Constructor: It looks like a method. It acts like a method more or less. But it is not a method.
It is kind of a special method whose name is same as the class name.
Constructor doesn't have any return type
If you add a return  type to a constructor, it will act like a normal method in java

Constructor will automatically be invoked when an object is created
Constructor:
Default constructor and parameterized constructor

Constructor overloading:


task 1 - create a calss called MyDetails. 

get ur name and ur age as input from the user
pass this input as arguments into a method called getMyDetails(cccccccc). 

return type of the mthod should be float.
method should print ur name
method should calculate -> ur age * 10 -> store it in a float variable. and return it
main method - get the returned value and print it from main method

task 2:
create a class. create 3 construcotrs - all should have some parameters- overloading 
inside each constructor, print the paramter values
