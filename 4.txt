Eclipse Editor , Net beans or Intellij - Editors or IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Latest version of java -8

what are using in ur project - java 7
Java -  version 7
Eclipse  - Oxygen 3a

Declaration:

int i=10;
float fl =1.2f;

Declaration Meaning - I am telling the JVM that there is going to be a variable of name 'x' of datatype 'y'

Initialization - if u are assigning a value to a variable at the beginning itslef it is called initialization;;


Variable - where can we declare? 
1.inside any method - it is called method variable or method local variable - It can be used only within that method. It cannot be used in any other method
2.. Class level or global variable - it can be used anywhere inside the class




Method level variable has to intialized during decalration itself. Else it will throw error
But Class level variable need not be initialized during declaration itself



If I dont initialize or provide any value to the class level variables then it will assume default values
Default values:
int - 0
boolean - false
String - null
float 0.0


First excercise - Declare global  variables for Double, Character and Long - Print the default values


Arithmetic operrations:
a+b 
a-b
a*b ->multiply
a/b ->gives quotient
a%bb - gives remindder

=============================

int a=635;

int b=83;

a/b +  a%b
