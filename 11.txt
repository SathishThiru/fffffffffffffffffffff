Object creation: Instance

Each objection creation creates a current instance or current copy of the class

During object creation, following happens:
1. new memory space is allocated
2. constructor is called
3. Instance or current copy of class will be created

static keyword: Very important 50%
static keyword can be used at variable level, method level and class level

use of static keyword:
if u declare a variable or method as static, then you need not create an object to call them.
u can directly call them using Classname.variable name or classname.methodName


static variable - address will never change. But value can be changed. 

non static variable - address will change for each object

static method - can be overloaded. but it cannot be overriden
.

why ststic method cannot be overriden - because memory address of the method block cannot be changed. so, it wont allow u to override


static keyword at class level
we cannot use static keyword at class level.
but if u want to use it, then u can use it for inner classes



final keyword: it can used with variable or method or class
if u declare a variable as final, its value cannot be changed
if u declare a method as final then it can be overloaded. but it cannot be overriden
if u declare a class as final, it cannot be inherited
final variable must definitely be initialized
