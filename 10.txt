this and super Keyword 

Main use case of these keywords comes into picture when both child and parent class have same variables or methods.

//to call a method in parent class from child class
		//MEthod 1: using parent class object
		A a = new A();
		a.getStudentId();
		
		//Method 2: using child class object 
		//Limitation - this method cant be used if both parent and child class
		//have same method name
		
		B b = new B();
		
		//Method 3: creating child class object and storing it in parent class reference
		
		A obj = new B();

this keyword cant be used inside a static method

int, float, String - thhey are all existing datatypes
Each class u create is its own custom datatype

if u want to call super super class constructor from child class, u can use super() method.
But, super method can be used only from child class constructor.

super method can only be used in first statement of child class constructor
if u want to call parameterized constructor, u can use super(parameters);


When u create an object for cchild class, it will first invoke parent class default constructor
and then only it will invoke child class constructor.
