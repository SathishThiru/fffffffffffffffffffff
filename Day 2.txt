Project Structure:
Project -> Collection of Packages -> Collection of classes -> Collection of methods, variables and objects

Naming convention:
Pascal Notation = First Character of all The words are Capital letters - FirstProjectOfJava (Project Name, Class Name)
Camel Case notation = firstProjectOfJava - (variable name, method name)

getStudentDetails()

packageName - all words are small letters in general - usually starts with 'com.', 'org.', etc

method format:

access_modifier returnType methodname(parameters)
{

//logic

}

To call a method, we need object


object ccrreation:
ClassNanme referenceName = new ClassName();

new keyword - creates a new memory/object

why should we create a method? - for achieving reusability


Create a project -> Create a package -> Create a class called CompanyDetails. Then Create a method called companyInfo(). When I call this method, it should print: 
'Company name is CTS'
'Company is located in Chennai'
