Polymorphism: Using same method with different logic
2 Types: Method overloading and method overriding

Method overloadig: Using saame method name inside same class but with some difference in the parameters.
Like order of the parameters, or datatype of the parameters, etc

Method overriding - Using same method name inside parent and child class but with different implementation logic









Homework:
Method overloading - create a class called Bank.  In that create 3 methods with same name as 'bankInfo' wuth different arguments. Each method should give some information of the bank


Multpile Inheritance is not directly possible in java. Reason is because of priority problem or deadly diamon problem.

Lets assume that we have two parent classes A and B. There is one child class C which inherits from both A and B. Now, lets assume that both A and B has same methods called 'print()' in them.
Now JVM will not know which 'print' method from which parent lcass to be called.

This is called priority issue

However, we can achieve multiple inheritance in java with 'Interfaces'.
