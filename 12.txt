String class and its inbuilt functionalities
String is a class that is inbuilt in java library.
Because it is a class, it has some predefined methods.
usage of these methods:

str.length() - to find length of the string
str.charAt(n) - to find the character present at nth positon
if u compare two string using'=='. For eg: str1==str2, it wont compare the values.
Rather it will compare the memory address
if u want to compare values of two strings u should use str1.equals(str2);
tr1.equalsIgnoreCase(str3)

str.contains("stringvalue") - return boolean value - 

str1.toUpperCase()
str1.toLoerCase()

String str2 = str1.substring(2); - creates a new substring that starts from index 2 till the end index and store it in str2

String str2 = str1.substring(2, 4)	; -Returns a string that is a substring of this string. Thesubstring begins at the specified beginIndex andextends to the character at index endIndex - 1.
isEmpty();
startsWith() and endsWith():

Literal String:
 It’s stored inside the heap memory (string pool or string constant).
 It will share the memory if same value (duplicate value)
Non-literal string:
 Its stored in the heap memory.
 Its create a new memory every time even if its duplicate value(same value)


Task: 
Declare a literal string - get input using scanner class from user and store it in the declared string
- print the middle character of the string and last character.

creata a method which accepts two caratcetrs a arguments  -char 1(middle character of above string),
char 2 - last character of above string 

method action - add two characters and print them

declare a literal string = "This is java training".
output - This is java train
