You cannnot create object for abstract class or interface

Why? In abstract class and interface we will be having abstract methods. These abstract methods will not be having any logic inside them.
The logic will be written inside child classes. So those methods can be called from child classes directly. So there is no need for object creation
of parent abstract or interfaces



if parent and child class have same method name and same arguments. And if u want to call parent class method from child class, then :
ParentClassName obj = new ChildClassName();
obj.methodName();

Encapsulation : It is a way to achieve security in java. We can deny access to class variables by making them private

Access smodifiers - public, protected, private and default
